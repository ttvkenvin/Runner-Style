# Description
Runner Style
Exercise is the healthiest way we exercise, stay in shape and stay young. Our application is to give users a simple and easy running software to calculate the amount of exercise.

Features:
You can draw the run path dynamically;
Intelligently determine the immediate running status;
Record operational data and generate a small card for sharing;
The bar chart shows the calories burned.


We need to get Apple's health-sharing data to calculate the calorie burned so that we can plot the data and visually see the calories burned every day.
